The structure primarily leverages path-based ownership for user expenses, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data. Authorization Independence is achieved because expense documents do not need to `get()` user documents to check authorization. QAPs are supported by segregating data based on user ownership, which allows for secure list operations using path-based rules. This design avoids complex rule logic and ensures that list operations are inherently secure. The timestamp field is included to enable ordered queries and chronological display of expenses."
